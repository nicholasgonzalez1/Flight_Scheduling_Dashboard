# Flight Scheduling Dashboard

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of this project was to improve flight scheduling for Orlando International Airport (MCO). Our team was tasked with using historical flight records from January 1st and 2nd of 2015 to predict the flight status for the 'then' incoming flights of January 3rd through 6th of 2015. After using a  statistical model to determine a flight's delay status, we implemented a simple heuristic for assigning them to a respective airport gate that also ensured to minimize the overall number of gates being utilized. An interactive gantt chart styled dashboard was then designed to display all appropriately scheduled incoming flights for MCO.
